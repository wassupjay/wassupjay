## Hi I'm Jayanth ðŸ‘‹
Iâ€™m a Generative AI Engineer with a solid background in data science and a deepening passion for creating agentic AI systems. My expertise lies in building end-to-end AI solutions that integrate large language models (LLMs), retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) workflows, and multi-agent orchestration to address real-world business challenges.

ðŸ’¡ Core Expertise

Generative AI: LangChain, OpenAI APIs, Claude, AutoGen, LangGraph, Prompt Engineering (CoT, ReAct, RAG, Guardrails), AI-SDK
Full-Stack AI Applications: Python, SQL, TypeScript, API integrations, Cloud Platforms (AWS, Azure)
Machine Learning: NLP, computer vision, data engineering, feature engineering,PyTorch, TensorFlow, Scikit-learn, MLOps,cloud AI platforms and multi-agent systems.

Currently, my focus is on designing intelligent agent architectures that combine LLM reasoning, structured retrieval pipelines, and real-time data to deliver scalable, reliable, and high-impact AI systems.
